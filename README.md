# Portfolio App

The Portfolio App started as live coding contest to test how fast I could work at that project.
Then, the app became a project assigned by nFactorial School in 2023.

## How to launch local server
### ```npm start```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser (Note: if 3000 port was available - otherwise, find port indicated at the terminal after ```npm start``` command).

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Acknowledgements
I want to thank nFactorial School team (especially Aruzhan Zhaubassar and Aruzhan Amangeldina) so much for sharing their knowledge and passion to programming! 🚀🤝🏽
